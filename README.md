acquainting myself with github

Hello folks, 19-year-old computer science student at the University of Cincinnati here.
I enjoy playing the piano, discovering new artists on Spotify, yearly Lord of the Rings re-reads, playing Mount and Blade, and sitting outside watching our chickens.

I took some low-quality coding courses in middle school, but taking AP CSP my senior year of high school really piqued my interest in the field
I'm working on CS50 right now, to supplement my college classes and start moving beyond declaring variables and creating functions, hopefully I can put all of my projects here!
